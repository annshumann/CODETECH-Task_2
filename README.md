Objective:

Track Academic Progress:

Provide a platform to record and monitor student grades across various subjects and courses over time.
Calculate Cumulative GPA:

Compute and display cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) based on the grades entered for each course or semester.
Generate Performance Reports:

Generate detailed reports and summaries of student performance, including trends, strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
Support Multiple Users and Courses:

Allow multiple users (students, teachers, administrators) to maintain separate profiles and manage grades for different courses or academic terms.
Facilitate Goal Setting and Progress Tracking:

Enable students to set academic goals, track their progress towards those goals, and receive notifications or reminders based on their performance.

Key Activities:

User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement secure user authentication to ensure only authorized individuals (students, teachers, administrators) can access and manage student grade data.
Data Input and Management:

Develop forms or interfaces for entering and managing student grades, including the ability to add new courses, assignments, and grades over time.
Grade Calculation and GPA Computation:

Implement algorithms to calculate individual course grades based on assignment scores, compute cumulative GPA, and possibly incorporate weighted averages for different grading scales.
Reporting and Analytics:

Design and generate reports that summarize student performance across courses and semesters, including graphical visualizations to highlight trends and areas for improvement.
Goal Setting and Progress Tracking:

Provide features for students to set academic goals, track their progress towards those goals, and receive feedback on their performance relative to their objectives.
